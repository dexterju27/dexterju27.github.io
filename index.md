## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profil-photo.jpg">

Hello! I am currently a Member of Technical Staff at Microsoft AI, where I focus on AI safety for foundational models. Previously, I worked as a Research Scientist on the LLaMA reasoning team at Meta GenAI / Superintelligence Labs, developing reinforcement learning approaches for reasoning models. Earlier in my career, I was a Research Engineer at Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
Over the years, I have had the opportunity to delve into a broad spectrum of AI topics. My work has spanned Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Conversational AI (which has now evolved into LLM), Safety and Responsible AI, and Core Machine Learning research.

Before joining Meta AI, I earned a Master's degree specializing in Machine Learning from Telecom ParisTech and University Paris 6. My academic journey has always been driven by a keen interest in both engineering and AI research. I am excited to continue exploring these fields and contributing to the advancements in AI technology.

I publish under the name Da JU.

## Research Interest

NLP, GenAI, RAI

## Academia

In 2015, I finished my undergraduate in Information Science and Engineering at [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), Nanjing, China. I wrote my [Bachelor's thesis](bachelor-thesis.pdf), "High-resolution LED Headlamps Testing System with Web GUI" at [L-LAB](http://www.l-lab.de/llab/index.html), Lippstadt, Germany. It documents the development of WiFi based system for controlling cars. The thesis remains Intellectual property of [HELLA](https://www.hella.com/hella-com/index.html).

In 2017, I finished my Master's degree at [Telecom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/), Paris, France, focussing on Machine Learning and Humain Computer Interaction. I also recived a second master degree from [UPMC university](http://www.upmc.fr/en/), Paris, France in Data Science.
